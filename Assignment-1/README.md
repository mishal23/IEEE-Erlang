# Assignment-1

### Introduction
This folder contains two modules : **myList.erl** & **complexCalc.erl**

- **myList.erl** : Five functions have been implemented ```lists:append()``` ; ```lists:last()``` ; ```lists:member()``` ; ```lists:sort()``` ; ```lists:sum()```

- **complexCalc.erl** : Module2 was adopted to get acquainted with the the **```math```** inbuilt functions in Erlang and developing a simple Calculator. Comments have been added in the code so as to avoid any confusion.

### Steps to follow to use the codes implemented.

- After cloning the repository, open the Erlang Shell and type.
```
cd("Path").   %%% The path of the Assignment-1 folder
```
- To check ```myList.erl``` 
```
c("myList").
```
- To check ```complexCalc.erl``` 
```
c("complexCalc").
```
And then the functions

Here is the output of the codes for both the files
